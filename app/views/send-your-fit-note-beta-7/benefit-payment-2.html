<p>This page will only appear when Secure Data Exchange (SDEX) or Document Repository System (DRS) are unavailable for more than 24 hours. When either of these is unavailable users can still submit a fit note using this service but benefit processing staff won't be able to process it until SDEX/DRS are available again.</p>
<p>This might cause a delay to payment depending on how long SDEX or DRS are down. If a user needs an urgent payment in these circumstances they should call the Get help number. They might advised to take their fit note to a jobcentre to arrange an urgent payment.
